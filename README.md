# lighthouse

## Description
Going to learn a bit of wood turning. Decided to mix it with my electronics
hobby, so I will make a lighthouse that has a Neopixel ring with 16 pixels at
the top. I will use a Digispark microcontroller to keep the size small although
the available memory is very limited.

## To-Do
- [ ] Fade one in and then one out and on to the next (and for two at a time)
    - [ ] White only
    - [ ] Multi coloured

- [x] Cyon effect (and for two at a time)
   - [x] White only
   - [x] Multi coloured (Change colour for each light)
   - [ ] Multi coloured (Change colour for each loop)
   - [ ] Don't fade to black, have all LED's fade to "dim"

- [ ] Random light sharp on and fade out (and for two at a time)
    - [ ] White only
    - [ ] Multi coloured (Random colour and rainbow pattern)

- [x] Always on but colour rotates (and for two at a time)
    - [ ] Fade in and out at the same time

- [ ] All on but the faded one rotates (like a reverse cyon (and for two at a time))
    - [ ] White only
    - [ ] Multi coloured

- [ ] Fade in and out

- [ ] Multiple LED's circling
    - [ ] White only
    - [ ] Multi coloured?

- [ ] Make some change direction?
