# lighthouse

## Description
Going to learn a bit of wood turning. Decided to mix it with my electronics
hobby, so I will make a lighthouse that has a Neopixel ring with 16 pixels at
the top. I will use a Digispark microcontroller to keep the size small although
the available memory is very limited.

## To-Do
- [ ] Fade one is and then one out and on to the next (and for two at a time)
    - [ ] White only
    - [ ] Multi coloured

- [ ] Cyon effect (and for two at a time)
   - [ ] White only
   - [ ] Multi coloured

- [ ] Random light sharp on and fade out (and for two at a time)
    - [ ] White only
    - [ ] Multi coloured (Random colour and rainbow pattern)

- [ ] Always on but colour rotates (and for two at a time)

- [ ] All on but the faded one rotates (like a reverse cyon (and for two at a time))
    - [ ] White only
    - [ ] Multi coloured
